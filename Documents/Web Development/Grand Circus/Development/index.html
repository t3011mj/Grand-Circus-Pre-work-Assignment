    The more than 100 billion gallons of precipitation that El Yunque receives annually spawn rushing streams and cascades, outsize impatiens and ferns, and 240 tree species. In the evening, millions of inch-long coquis (tree frogs) begin their calls. El Yunque is also home to the cotorra, Puerto Rico's endangered green parrot, as well as 67 other types of birds. </p>
   <p>
    El Yunque is the only tropical rain forest in the U.S. National Forest System, spanning 28,000 acres, reaching an elevation of more than 3,500 ft. and receiving an estimated average of 200 - 240 inches of rain each year. The forest's 13 hiking trails are well-maintained; many of them are easy to navigate and less than a mile long. If you prefer to see the sights from a car, as many people do, simply follow Route 191 as it winds into the mountains and stop at several observation points along the way.</p></blockquote>
